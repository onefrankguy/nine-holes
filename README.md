# Nine Holes #

How do you make a video game?

When I created [Prolix][], I didn't know what I was doing. I had a basic
understanding of web design, but I didn't know JavaScript. What I wanted was a
video game built on open web standards. Something where I could read the code
and understand it and change the rules and make it my own.

This is that game.

If you'd like to play **Nine Holes**, you can do that at
